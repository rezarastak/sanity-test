# sanity-test
Performs simple tests on non-unit-tested libraries. 

You can use this python library to search for some specific file names and perform automated checks and sanity tests on them. For example, it can search for all files names `run.py`, run mypy and flake08 on them, and then run the file for a couple of seconds to see if there is a crash.
